# tweety-582
IRC music-oriented chatbot for CSC-582

## Running the project

**Note:**
*As of 2/12, required file dependencies are automatically downloaded at runtime*

We recommend using a [python virtual evironment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this project.

1. Install the required python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the `run.py` file with `python run.py -c "#EXAMPLE_CHANNEL"` (the -c flag
   is optional, defaults to "#CSC582")

The first time you run the project, it may take a few minutes to automatically
download the required files depending on the speed of your internet connection.
